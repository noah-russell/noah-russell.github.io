    <title>Neuroplasticity</title>

  <p>
    Neuroplasticity is a fundamental property of the brain and how it learns,
    remembers, and adapts to new experiences. It's the brain's ability to build
    up neural pathways, restructuring itself, in order to learn and adapt is the
    reason we can remember speech, or how to drive cars, or how to write or
    spell words or tell the time, etc.! With the understanding that the physical
    pathways in my brain can, with conscious effort, be developed over time with
    repetition. People who confront challenges, invest in the future, and make
    sacrifices in the name of greater things, all had better mental
    healthConfronting challenges improves the brains ability to adapt, while
    repetition strengthens those new formed neural pathways thereby reinforcing
    the memory. Here's a video I found helpful:

    A growth mindset is the idea that your brain and your mind aren't fixed
    entities. It's the recognition that skills can be gained through exploration
    and repetition. This is vital when entering a rapid-learning environment,
    like the tech world. I guess it was instilled by my parents, but I've always
    understood that I could learn anything I set my mind to, even if it was
    hard. I have, however, found myself habitually avoiding challenges as of
    late, simply as a result of bad habits that have formed over the last couple
    years. I think by mindfully paying attention to my brain as I confront
    challenges, I'll remind myself that my brain isn't fixed, or static, it can
    be trained and improved. Here's a video I found helpful:

    I'll integrate these new understandings into my approach to learning. I
    think my lack of focus comes from the fear of failing difficult tasks, and
    so as an instinctively defensive move my mind tends to wander and focus on
    safe, trivial thoughts. If I can distance my ego from my learning, the fear
    will fall away and my focus will hold longer on difficult tasks. Repeating
    this will in turn help me overcome counter-productive habits, thereby
    exponentially improving my ability to learn and work.
