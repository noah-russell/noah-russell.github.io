    <title>Identity and Values</title>

    <p>
      It was only in recent years that I made efforts to identify and
      familiarize myself with my values, strengths and weaknesses. Likewise,
      it's only very recently that I started coming to terms with my identity,
      and what it means to me. I grew up in a family that embraced both Polish
      and Maori traditions, but we only ever thought of ourselves New
      Zealanders. It wasn't until I was a teenager that it ever really occurred
      to me that not every native New Zealander had Maori roots, and that it was
      something worth embracing. It wasn't until the last few years of my life
      that I actively chose to recognise and embrace my heritage and culture as
      part of my identity. I think primarily, I allow others to identify me
      however they want, but to me, in my own head, I like to think I'm an
      artist at heart, and so everything I do in life serves my artistic
      ambitions. However, my values regarding family, friends and those in wider
      society drive me as much in my pursuit of success as the art does. The
      better I do, the more I have to offer to those close to me.

      I learned most of my core values from my mum. She instilled in me a high
      degree of empathy, optimism, the conviction of supporting those in need,
      and the permission to be curious and ask questions. For as long as I can
      remember she's encouraged me to explore my creativity and any other
      venture I take. I've seen first-hand how she's taken on massive
      responsiblities simply because she believes someone has to, and I like to
      think I've taken that to heart. I also learned from my step dad and
      granddad that you can make anything you set your mind to, and not to be
      afraid to take things apart and mess around with them.

      I'd say creativity, curiousity, persistence, optimism, empathy, and good
      intentions are my strengths. I apparently have quite an open personality
      according to the two personality tests I took. I also have a wide range of
      digital and physical skills, which I've found has made embracing a lot of
      the new ideas and concepts in this course quite familiar. I've found that
      many problem solving approaches can be taken across different skillsets,
      and have learned how to manipulate the world in many different mediums.
      I'm also highly organized, at least spacially. I own no clutter, I keep
      all my workspaces extremely tidy and optimized for whatever work takes
      place there. My limitations, on the other hand, are most definitely
      showing right now. Years of bad habits have accumulated while I've been
      building various strengths up in my personal time. I have a real hard time
      focusing on work, and I've grown used to learning at a much slower pace
      than is required of me here. I have to be more deliberate about how I
      spend my time each day, and how I can better optimise it for achieving my
      goals. I can do the work, I can do the learning, and I can output good
      work, I just need to increase my pace, build my focus, and excersise
      self-discipline in my time-management.

      In my previous work, I was heading a small-scale prop-making production in
      which we were making parts for modular lightsabers. Fun stuff, anyway, I
      had the most knowledge and experience with all of the processes and skills
      we were using, and so I became somewhat of the defacto head of the
      operation. This made one of the guys I was working with quite
      uncomfortable, as he was older and envisaged himself more as the "boss".
      Seeking a diplomatic solution to what I figured was only a natural
      reaction to changing circumstances, I started handing responsibilities to
      this coworker so they had something that felt to them like control and
      responsibility; I asked if he would take on the mold/casting process,
      which would both eleviate the burden of work on me, and make my coworker
      feel more like my peer than a "boss". This worked for a time, and enabled
      the continuation of the production, but, in the end, my relationshop with
      this coworker deteriorated to the point where I made the decision to
      cleanly, calmly leave the business, take what was owed to me, then step
      away with no quarrels. In future, I know to be conscious of other's
      thoughts and feelings regarding their role in a collaborative project.
