    <title>Identity and Values</title>

      It was only in recent years that I made efforts to identify and
      familiarize myself with my values, strengths and weaknesses. Likewise,
      it's only very recently that I started coming to terms with my identity,
      and what it means to me. I grew up in a family that embraced both Polish
      and Maori traditions, but we only ever thought of ourselves New
      Zealanders. It wasn't until I was a teenager that it ever really occurred
      to me that not every native New Zealander had Maori roots, and that it was
      something worth embracing. It wasn't until the last few years of my life
      that I actively chose to recognise and embrace my heritage and culture as
      part of my identity. I think primarily, I allow others to identify me
      however they want, but to me, in my own head, I like to think I'm an
      artist at heart, and so everything I do in life serves my artistic
      ambitions. However, my values regarding family, friends and those in wider
      society drive me as much in my pursuit of success as the art does. The
      better I do, the more I have to offer to those close to me.

      I learned most of my core values from my mum. She instilled in me a high
      degree of empathy, optimism, the conviction of supporting those in need,
      and the permission to be curious and ask questions. For as long as I can
      remember she's encouraged me to explore my creativity and any other
      venture I take. I've seen first-hand how she's taken on massive
      responsiblities simply because she believes someone has to, and I like to
      think I've taken that to heart. I also learned from my step dad and
      granddad that you can make anything you set your mind to, and not to be
      afraid to take things apart and mess around with them.

      I'd say creativity, curiousity, persistence, optimism, empathy, and good
      intentions are my strengths. I apparently have quite an open personality
      according to the two personality tests I took. I also have a wide range of
      digital and physical skills, which I've found has made embracing a lot of
      the new ideas and concepts in this course quite familiar. My limitations,
      on the other hand, are most definitely showing right now.
