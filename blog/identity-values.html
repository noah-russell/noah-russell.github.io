      It was only in recent years that I made efforts to identify and
      familiarize myself with my values, strengths and weaknesses. Likewise,
      it's only very recently that I started coming to terms with my identity,
      and what it means to me. I grew up in a family that embraced both Polish
      and Maori traditions, but I only ever thought of myself as a New
      Zealander. It wasn't until I was a teenager that it ever really occurred
      to me that not every native New Zealander had Maori roots, and it wasn't
      until the last few years of my life that I actively chose to recognise and
      embrace my heritage and culture as part of my identity.

      I learned most of my core values from my Mum. She instilled in me a high
      degree of empathy, optimism, the conviction of supporting those in need,
      and the permission to be curious and ask questions. For as long as I can
      remember she's encouraged me to explore my creativity and any other
      venture I take.

      My strengths and limitations have never been more obvious to me than right
      now, during this course.
