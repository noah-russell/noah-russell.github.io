    <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
    <p>
      In the world of web development, HTML and CSS form the basis of
      everything. HTML provides the content and structure, while CSS dictates
      the styling, colors and layout. But how do these two documents work
      together to build websites? One way is with classes and IDs. Being as
      crucial and widely used as they are, there are particular ways of using
      them to ensure an efficient and productive workflow.

      Classes are labels applicable to elements within HTML. They enable you to
      apply the same cosmetic change to multiple HTML elements. IDs allow you to
      style specific elements in HTML that don't have any duplicates. Best
      practices include consistent, descriptive, semantic naming conventions
      (avoiding global names), organisation using groups and line breaks, and
      avoiding redundancy to ensure efficient code.
