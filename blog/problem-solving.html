      So, for one of the challenges, we had to write a function that would
      capitalize the first letter of every word in a given sentence. Sounds
      simple, and I guess it is, but with the understanding I had going into the
      challenge, I made it harder than it needed to be. The first 2 approaches I
      took weren't working, as I was trying to use a lot of syntax I'd only just
      partially learned, and didn't actually understand. I eventually decided to
      clear my work and start from scratch, this time spending a little more
      time on the pseudocode, until I had enough to re-write it in actual code.
      I got a little frustrated with my self for taking so long to get through
      it, but mostly my focus was just on solving it, rather than feeling any
      particular way about it. I learned to take the simplest approach that uses
      what you know first, then work up from there, rather than trying to make
      the code nice and elegent on the first go.

      I like to think my Fizzbuzz solution was elegant. To solve the Fizzbuzz
      challenge, we had to write a function that takes a number as input and
      returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5,
      and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by 15. If it was any other number, it just had
      to return the number as-is. Instead of jumping straight into coding, I
      took my time with the planning on this one. I simply took the requirements
      of the challenge into pseudocode, then expanded on them. I took the
      requirements very literally and extracted the solution straight from them.
      I was able to translate the pseduocode into actual code and solve it
      exactly how I understood it would. I'm sure there's a finer way to solve
      it, but it was quite satisfying to solve it so practically and logically.
      I learned the utter importance of reading the requirements and
      understanding them entirely. The requirements, in a way, are the answers.

      I really like the process of writing pseudocode, it's the direct
      translation between the requirements and the code. I know I still have a
      lot to learn, but I'm comfortable with it in the sense that I enjoy it.
      "Trying something" is simply necessary, I think, and I've had a lot of
      success with it, but it can sometimes be nerve-wracking attempting an
      approach that might be a waste of time. I like the "rubber ducky" method,
      although I don't say anything out loud, I just imagine there's an audience
      to my thoughts and pace while I think. Reading error messages is a bit
      daunting, but it's nice when it works. Console logging, I've been avoiding
      it as it hasn't been required to pass most tests, and I think because of
      that I'm not comfortable using it at the moment. Googling, now that I can
      do. Very comfortable terrain for me. The internet is an ungodly source of
      information and it's all accessible, all the answers, and I approach it as
      such. Asking peers for help is something I absolutely WILL do in future,
      and have done a lot in the past, but because of how far behind I was with
      all the sprints, I avoided asking any of my homegroup for help as I felt
      embarrassed by how far behind I was, and asking them for help on any of it
      would reveal how far back I was. Usually I'm very comfortable asking peers
      for help, but the circumstances were different this time. I eventually
      found that I was comfortable asking my facilitator for help, but until
      late into Sprint 4, I didn't have many questions I wasn't able to answer
      in a reasonable time, although I did ask for a question I spent almost an
      hour on. Reflection definitely helps, and I notice when I don't do it. I
      find it takes me way too long, but I do find it helpful.
