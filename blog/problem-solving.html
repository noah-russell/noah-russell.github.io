      So, for one of the challenges, we had to write a function that would
      capitalize the first letter of every word in a given sentence. Sounds
      simple, and I guess it is, but with the understanding I had going into the
      challenge, I made it harder than it needed to be. The first 2 approaches I
      took weren't working, as I was trying to use a lot of syntax I'd only just
      partially learned, and didn't actually understand. I eventually decided to
      clear my work and start from scratch, this time spending a little more
      time on the pseudocode, until I had enough to re-write it in actual code.
      I got a little frustrated with my self for taking so long to get through
      it, but mostly my focus was just on solving it, rather than feeling any
      particular way about it. I learned to take the simplest approach that uses
      what you know first, then work up from there, rather than trying to make
      the code nice and elegent on the first go.

      I like to think my Fizzbuzz solution was elegant. To solve the Fizzbuzz
      challenge, we had to write a function that takes a number as input and
      returns "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 5,
      and "FizzBuzz" if divisible by 15. If it was any other number, it just had
      to return the number as-is. Instead of jumping straight into coding, I
      took my time with the planning on this one. I simply took the requirements
      of the challenge into pseudocode, then expanded on them. I took the
      requirements very literally and extracted the solution straight from them.
      I was able to translate the pseduocode into actual code and solve it
      exactly how I understood it would. I'm sure there's a finer way to solve
      it, but it was quite satisfying to solve it so practically and logically.
      I learned the utter importance of reading the requirements and
      understanding them entirely. The requirements, in a way, are the answers.
