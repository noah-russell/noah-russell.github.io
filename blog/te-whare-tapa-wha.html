    <h1>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h1>
    <p>
      I've started making sure my diet actually sustains me and gives me what my
      body needs. I achieve this by managing the food I buy, making a habit of
      cooking and preparing meals at appropriate times, and taking vitamins and
      supplements to ensure a well-rounded diet. I also need to get more
      physical exercise which I plan to do by training cardio and muscles
      regularly.

    <h1>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h1>
    <p>
      Keeping a positive, optimistic attitude, embracing challenges, taking
      breaks regularly, and taking time to do something creative at least once a
      week. Socializing and keeping up with family also goes a long way with
      mental and emotional health.
    </p>
    <h1>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h1>
    <p>
      I try to adhere to my values, and I try to choose values that benefit me
      and the people I care about. I'll continue to explore my values and
      beliefs in an attempt to better articulate them.
    </p>
    <h1>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</h1>
    <p>
      I make sure to spend time with my family and friends, and keep in touch
      with them often through social media. I also make things for them as it's
      my way of showing love.
    </p>
    <h1>Whenua (land)</h1>
    <p>
      I like to think I notice things about the world that people often overlook
      or take for granted. I love staring at the night sky, pondering the
      universe, looking out for shooting stars and satellites. Or even just
      watching and listening to the birds in the back yard. I believe taking
      moments to be present in the outside world is important for my mind.
