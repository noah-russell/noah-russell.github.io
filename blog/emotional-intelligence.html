    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to attune ones' self to
      others' emotions; recognising, understanding and empathizing with them.
      It's also the ability to recognise and manage ones' own emotions. A high
      degree of EQ grants one the ability to communicate with others more
      effectively, handle challenging situations with maturity and grace, and
      better utilize their emotions and thought patterns for more positive
      outcomes.
