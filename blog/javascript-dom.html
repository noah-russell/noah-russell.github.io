    <h1>JavaScript and the DOM</h1>
    <p>
      If a website were a car, HTML would be the chassis, wheels seats, windows
      - everything that makes up the basic structure of the vehicle. CSS is like
      the paint job, the interior design, and that glue-on ABS spoiler your boy
      racer mate sold you cheap as. JavaScript is what makes everything actually
      run and move. It's the engine, the gearbox, the speedo', the wiring
      harness - all the bits that do stuff.

      The control flow is the order in which the computer executes instructions
      contained within a script, such as a loop or a function. A loop is like a
      set of instructions, to be completed in a specified order, and then
      repeated until told to stop. And make no mistake, a computer will continue
      to run loops over and over and over again, unless explicitly told to stop.
      I think of it like vacuuming - there's a logical sequence of steps you
      need to take in order to effectively vacuum your house, and you repeat (or
      loop) those steps for each room you clean. First, you plug it in, next you
      turn it on, then you vacuum the floor from one side of the room to the
      other, then you turn it off, then you move to the next room - you then
      repeat that loop until your whole house is vacuumed.
