    <h1>JavaScript and the DOM</h1>
    <p>
      If a website were a car, HTML would be the chassis, wheels seats, windows
      - everything that makes up the basic structure of the vehicle. CSS is like
      the paint job, the interior design, and that glue-on ABS spoiler your boy
      racer mate sold you cheap as. JavaScript is what makes everything actually
      run and move. It's the engine, the gearbox, the speedo', the wiring
      harness - all the bits that do stuff.
