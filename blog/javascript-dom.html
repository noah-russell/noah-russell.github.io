    <h1>JavaScript and the DOM</h1>
    <p>
      If a website were a car, HTML would be the chassis, wheels seats, windows
      - everything that makes up the basic structure of the vehicle. CSS is like
      the paint job, the interior design, and that glue-on ABS spoiler your boy
      racer mate sold you cheap as. JavaScript is what makes everything actually
      run and move. It's the engine, the gearbox, the speedo', the wiring
      harness - all the bits that do stuff.

      The control flow is the order in which the computer executes instructions
      contained within a script, such as a loop or a function. A loop is like a
      set of instructions, to be completed in a specified order, and then
      repeated until told to stop. And make no mistake, a computer will continue
      to run loops over and over and over again, unless explicitly told to stop.
      I think of it like vacuuming - there's a logical sequence of steps you
      need to take in order to effectively vacuum your house, and you repeat (or
      loop) those steps for each room you clean. First, you plug it in, next you
      turn it on, then you vacuum the floor from one side of the room to the
      other, then you turn it off, then you move to the next room - you then
      repeat that loop until your whole house is vacuumed.

      The Document Object Model, or DOM, is a programming tool used for
      interfacing with web documents. It represents a webpage as a tree, where
      each HTML element is represented as a node on that tree, which the
      programmer can then manipulate and interact with. You use it when you want
      to make changes to specific elements of a webpage without forcing the
      entire page to reload. For example; when you're on a website that sells
      clothing, you click on, say, a hoodie, and you're brought to a page for
      that hoodie. Often, there'll be a range of color options, which when a
      color option is clicked, updates color of the hoodie. That's the DOM in
      action.

      Arrays are ordered collections accessed by assigned numbers, while objects
      are collections of properties which define the object's behavior. Arrays
      are typically used for lists of similar items, while objects are used when
      associating values with named keys, usually representing attributes of a
      standalone entity. Accessing array elements is done by index (array[0]),
      while accessing object values is done by key (object['key'] or
      object.key). Arrays are suited for ordered data, while objects are best at
      handling unordered, structured data.

      Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific set of tasks They can
      take input parameters, perform operations, and output results. They're
      helpful because they can be reused multiple times for different elements,
      rather than making programmers type the same function out over and over
      again.
