    <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I'd like to tell stories for a living. The medium could be
      phyisical, digital, aural, in the form of books or sculptures or songs or
      paintings or costumes. It could be anything, so long as it tells the story
      I want to tell at the time. I'd also like to make a comfortable living,
      and so my plan is to work a career of programming while I build by
      narrative projects in my spare time. I also fully intend to integrate the
      skills I learn in programming to my creative work, in as many ways as
      possible.
    </p>

      I'm a slow learner, but a thorough one. My rate of learning is limited by
      my lack of ability to sustain focus, and I find it takes me a while to
      articulate my thoughts clearly. My time-management skills suck as a
      result, and I tend to spend too long on tasks that I could do much quicker
      if I only focused properly. These are all skills I know I need to
      cultivate and nourish with practice if I'm to become someone able and
      willing to learn and work productively. Once I've conquered the
      self-discipline of focus, flow-state, and time-management, I'll be capable
      of realizing my full potential. My strength lies in my passion for
      problem-solving. I understand the world as a place wherein problems arise
      continually, and those problems become responsibilities - someone has to
      take responsibility for solving them, big or small. I believe one has to
      voluntarily take responsibility for things in life, and that what you
      choose to be responsible for determines the person you become, whether
      you're conscious of it or not. I enjoy too any chance I get to incoporate
      new skills into my creative projects, as I see skills and processes like
      tools for presenting a particular perspective or narrative to the world. I
      tend to develop the most expresive skills to the highest degree, the more
      you can do with a skill, the more reason to develop it. Ideally, I'd like
      to master focus and time-management, and as much of the technical stuff as
      I can.

      I've been given a specific date that everything needs to be completed by,
      and I've skimmed through all the Foundations handbook material in advance
      so I'm aware of what needs to be done, and roughly how long each thing
      will take to do. Between now and the due date, I've allocated hours and
      progress to particular days, and as long as I stick to a consistent pace,
      I'll get everything done in time. I'll take a lot of breaks, aiming to
      take less as time goes on - try to build up that focus. Mostly I intend to
      seek help from the internet, MDN is super helpful, and I'm beginning to
      meet more and more people who program for a living, so I'll begin asking
      them for help as I start needing it.
    </p>

      From the facilitation team, I expect to learn WHAT we should be focusing
      on learning, and hopefully HOW to learn. I would really benefit from a
      wide range of opinions on how to enforce self-discipline.
    </p>

      Other commitments? There's always life stuff, life events and the like.
      But nothing recurrent
