      Ultimately, I'd like to tell stories for a living. The medium could be
      phyisical, digital, aural, in the form of books or sculptures or songs or
      paintings or costumes. It could be anything, so long as it tells the story
      I want to tell at the time. I'd also like to make a comfortable living,
      and so my plan is to work a career of programming while I build by
      narrative projects in my spare time. I also fully intend to integrate the
      skills I learn in programming to my creative work, in as many ways as
      possible.

      I'm a slow learner, but a thorough one. My rate of learning is limited by
      my lack of ability to sustain focus,
