    <h1>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </h1>
    <p>
      First, I learned that I lack a great deal of self-discipline of the mind,
      and that it's a skill I need to learn rapidly if I'm to keep up with the
      work load. I learned that while I may be technically capable of achieving
      a task, I still face challenges that affect the pace and quality of my
      learning, and I have had to be open and honest with myself if I'm to reach
      my potential. I also learned that when I don't feel confident about my
      learning abilities, I tend to lose confidence in general, so I need to
      stay on top of the learning if I'm to retain a healthy mind.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I believe my values, my belief in the importance of empathy, and my
      increased self-awareness dictate my motivations, and therefore my actions.
      My intention is to improve myself to be the best version of myself that I
      can be so that I have the most to offer those around me.
    </p>

    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      How challenging it would be to actually implement. Even being as open to
      it as I was, I found it really difficult. I was also surprised by how much
      trouble I had articulating my thoughts and answers.
    </p>

    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
    <p>
      As I just mentioned, implementing the learning. Without a rigid
      structure/timetable to work from, I had to determine my own, and my values
      while solid in my own mind, weren't quite aligning with my work output. I
      had to make very conscious effort to be mindful of my learning and
      behaviour over the past few weeks. Simply being mindful did start to help
      though.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h5>
    <p>
      It's clear to me that the core skills are the real focus of the learning,
      and completion of the technical work is simply evidence of well-integrated
      core skills. They're fundamental to who you are as a person, which
      determines what kind of work you'll output, and what kinds of problems
      you'll be capable of solving.
    </p>

    <h6>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h6>
    <p>
      No, in fact I view it as the most valuable learning I'm doing here, for me
      personally. If I'm able to solidify my core skills, I'll have a solid
      foundation to build my technical skills on.
